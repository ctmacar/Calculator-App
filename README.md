- Process

  I've managed to complete the javascript calculator but It's including only four operations. That was a really "think outside of the box" challenge for me 'cause I've struggled with the simplification of my codes. But that helped me about the new understandings of Javascript.


- Missings

  I could've add more addition to this calculator such as percentage operation or exponential numbers etc.
